I have recently converted my site from using wordpress to [autogenerated HTML using markdown and python](autogenerated_html_using_markdown_and_python.html).

This has increased the speed of the site and made it easier to move around from hosting provider to hosting provider.


wordpress speeds
--------------------

```sh
Connection Times (ms)
              min  mean[+/-sd] median   max
Connect:      184  186   1.2    186     188
Processing:   765  811  46.6    811     891
Waiting:      459  502  41.9    501     572
Total:        950  997  47.2    998    1077
```

As you can see the speeds where pretty consistent around the 950ms to 998 ms; a range of 48ms.
However 950ms is way to slow for a website.


static html speed
--------------------


```sh
Connection Times (ms)
              min  mean[+/-sd] median   max
Connect:       34   35   0.8     36      37
Processing:    31   34   1.6     34      36
Waiting:       31   34   1.6     34      36
Total:         65   69   2.3     70      72
```

This is a massive speed difference at the trade off of writing markdown and compiling it into HTML rather than writing into a rich text editor.
